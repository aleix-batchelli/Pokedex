Pokedex  
1 - Create a new project in Android Studio and set up the basic UI elements for your app. You will need a main activity, a layout file for the main activity, and a navigation graph to manage fragments.  2- Create a fragment for displaying a list of Pokemon. You can use a RecyclerView to display the list and create a custom adapter to populate it with data. You will also need to define a layout file for the fragment.  3 - Create a fragment for displaying detailed information about a selected Pokemon. This fragment will be launched when a user selects a Pokemon from the list in the first fragment. You will need to define a layout file for this fragment as well.  4 - Set up communication between the two fragments using a shared ViewModel or interface. When a user selects a Pokemon from the list in the first fragment, the selected Pokemon's information should be passed to the second fragment for display.  5 - Implement the logic for fetching data about the Pokemon from a data source, such as an API or a local database. You will need to handle network requests and parse JSON data to populate your list and display detailed information about each Pokemon.  
6 - Add any additional features you want to include in your Pokedex app, such as search functionality or filtering by type or region.
